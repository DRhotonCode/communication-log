   <p>Radio check. Pilot, please confirm.</p>

   <p><b>Yes, Doctor.  Radio check confirmed! We need more masks to contain this virus!</b></p>

   <p><em>We're in a shortage of masks. Try using shirts or other porous materials. </em></p>

   <p>Confirmed! All shirts have been exhausted by citizens attempting the t-shirt / handstand challenge!  We may have to pivot!  Are there any further updates on a cure?</p>
   
   <p><h2> Social distancing. Maintain a distance of 6ft and keep clean until further notice.</h2></p>
